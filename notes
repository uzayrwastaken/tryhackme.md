# Cybersecurity basics
-dirb is a tool that uses the Brute force attack method to exploit
-Now I understand how to use SIEM
-The purpose of many cybersecurity tools
-difference between red team and blue team

#Networking

-MAC addresses never change on the device and can be faked
-Ping is a measure of the time taken of ICMP packets to travel
-Routers use packet switching to break down pieces of data into smaller chunks called packets
-Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself
-IP address is made up of four sections called octets
-Subnets use IP adresses to: 
-Identify the network address, This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence
-Identify the host address, An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
-Identify the default gateway, special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network 
-32 bits in a subnet(same as IP address)
-ARP protocol (Address Resolution Protocol), is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network
-ARP allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network by using ARP request and ARP reply
-In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network
-IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP server
-When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network
- The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer)
- The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request)
-the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).
-OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model),  provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.(has 7 layers)
-Encapsulation is the term for when pieces of info get added to data
