# Cybersecurity basics
-dirb is a tool that uses the Brute force attack method to exploit
-Now I understand how to use SIEM
-The purpose of many cybersecurity tools
-difference between red team and blue team

#Networking

-MAC addresses never change on the device and can be faked
-Ping is a measure of the time taken of ICMP packets to travel
-Routers use packet switching to break down pieces of data into smaller chunks called packets
-Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself
-IP address is made up of four sections called octets
-Subnets use IP adresses to: 
-Identify the network address, This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence
-Identify the host address, An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
-Identify the default gateway, special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network 
-32 bits in a subnet(same as IP address)
-ARP protocol (Address Resolution Protocol), is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network
-ARP allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network by using ARP request and ARP reply
-In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network
-IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP server
-When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network
- The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer)
- The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request)
-the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).
-OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model),  provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.(has 7 layers)
-Encapsulation is the term for when pieces of info get added to data
-Graphical User Interface (GUI) is  for users to interact with data sent or received
-Presentation layer's main purpose is translating
-Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it
-routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.
-Network layer is where the routing and re-assembly of data takes place
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) incorporates error checking into its design so TCP can guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer has then been received and reassembled in the same order.
- User Datagram Protocol(UDP), doesn't care if the data is received.
- session layer (layer 5) will begin to create and maintain the connection to other computer for which the data is destined
-Packets and frames are small pieces of data that
-Packet is used when IP addresses are involved
-TCP is connection based
