#Networking

-MAC addresses never change on the device and can be faked
-Ping is a measure of the time taken of ICMP packets to travel
-Routers use packet switching to break down pieces of data into smaller chunks called packets
-Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself
-IP address is made up of four sections called octets
-Subnets use IP adresses to: 
-Identify the network address, This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence
-Identify the host address, An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
-Identify the default gateway, special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network 
-32 bits in a subnet(same as IP address)
-ARP protocol (Address Resolution Protocol), is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network
-ARP allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network by using ARP request and ARP reply
-In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network
-IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP server
-When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network
- The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer)
- The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request)
-the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).
-OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model),  provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.(has 7 layers)
-Encapsulation is the term for when pieces of info get added to data
-Graphical User Interface (GUI) is  for users to interact with data sent or received
-Presentation layer's main purpose is translating
-Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it
-routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.
-Network layer is where the routing and re-assembly of data takes place
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) incorporates error checking into its design so TCP can guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer has then been received and reassembled in the same order.
- User Datagram Protocol(UDP), doesn't care if the data is received.
- session layer (layer 5) will begin to create and maintain the connection to other computer for which the data is destined
-Packets and frames are small pieces of data that
-Packet is used when IP addresses are involved
-TCP is connection based

#How the web works
-DNS (Domain Name System) provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers
-A TLD is the most righthand part of a domain name. So, for example, the tryhackme.com TLD is .com
-When registering a domain name, the second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (tryhackme is the second level)
-A subdomain sits on the left-hand side of the Second-Level Domain using a period to separate it
-Max character length of a domain is 253
-A Record resolve to IPv4 addresses, for example 104.26.10.229
-AAAA Record resolve to IPv6 addresses, for example 2606:4700:20::681a:be5
-CNAME Record resolve to another domain name, for example, TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com
-MX Record resolve to the address of the servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying
-TXT Record are free text fields where any text-based data can be stored

#DNS request
-Your computer checks its local DNS cache first — if it doesn’t have the domain saved, it asks the Recursive DNS server
-The Recursive DNS server checks its own cache — if it finds the result, it sends it back to your device
-If not, the Recursive server asks the Root DNS server, which redirects it to the right TLD
-The TLD server sends the Recursive server to the Authoritative Name Server, which knows the exact IP of the domain
-The Authoritative Name Server returns the DNS record, which gets cached by the Recursive server and sent back to your device

#HTTP in detail
-HTTP is the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmitting of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc
-HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS data is encrypted so it not only stops people from seeing the data you are receiving and sending
-URL is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet
-Scheme: This instructs on what protocol to use for accessing the resource such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
-User: Some services require authentication to log in, you can put a username and password into the URL to log in
-Host: The domain name or IP address of the server you wish to access
-Port: The Port that you are going to connect to, usually 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but this can be hosted on any port between 1 - 65535
-Path: The file name or location of the resource you are trying to access
-Query String: Extra bits of information that can be sent to the requested path. For example, /blog?id=1 would tell the blog path that you wish to receive the blog article with the id of 1
-Fragment: This is a reference to a location on the actual page requested
-GET Request used for getting information from a web server
-POST Request used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records
-PUT Request used for submitting data to a web server to update information
-DELETE Request used for deleting information/records from a web server

#HTTP status codes
-100-199 Information Response	These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common.
-200-299 Success This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.
-300-399  Redirection	These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.
-400-499  Client Errors	Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.
-500-599  Server Errors	This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicate quite a major problem with the server handling the request.

# Common codes
-200 - OK	The request was completed successfully.
-201 - Created	A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).
-301 - Moved Permanently	This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.
-302 - Found	Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.
-400 - Bad Request	This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.
-401 - Not Authorised	You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.
-403 - Forbidden	You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.
-405 - Method Not Allowed	The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.
-404 - Page Not Found	The page/resource you requested does not exist.
-500 - Internal Service Error	The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.
-503 - Service Unavailable This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.

#﻿These are headers that are sent from the client (usually your browser) to the server
-Headers are additional bits of data you can send to the web server when making requests.
-Host: Some web servers host multiple websites so by providing the host headers you can tell it which one you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server
-User-Agent: This is your browser software and version number, telling the web server your browser software helps it format the website properly for your browser
-Content-Length: When sending data to a web server such as in a form, the content length tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data
-Accept-Encoding: Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet
-Cookie: Data sent to the server to help remember your information

#These are the headers that are returned to the client from the server after a request
-Set-Cookie: Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request 
-Cache-Control: How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again
-Content-Type: This tells the client what type of data is being returned
-Content-Encoding: What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet

-cookies are small pieces of data that is stored on your computer
- web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests
-Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website
-Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response
-HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the language websites are written in
-Elements (also known as tags) are the building blocks of HTML pages and tells the browser how to display content

#HTML
-The <!DOCTYPE html> defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardisation across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
-The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page - all other elements come after this element.
-The <head> element contains information about the page (such as the page title)
-The <body> element defines the HTML document's body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser.
-The <h1> element defines a large heading
-The <p> element defines a paragraph
-There are many other elements (tags) used for different purposes. For example, there are tags for buttons (<button>), images (<img>), lists, and much more

#Javacript
 -JavaScript is used to control the functionality of web pages - without JavaScript, a page would not have interactive elements

- Load balancers provide two main features, ensuring high traffic websites can handle the load and providing a failover if a server becomes unresponsive
-CDN (Content Delivery Networks) allows you to host static files from your website, such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, Videos, and host them across thousands of servers all over the world
-Webservers can communicate with databases to store and recall data from them
-WAF (Web Application Firewall) sits between your web request and the web server; its primary purpose is to protect the webserver from hacking or denial of service attacks
-A web server is a software that listens for incoming connections and then utilises the HTTP protocol to deliver web content to its clients
-Web servers can host multiple websites with different domain names; to achieve this, they use virtual hosts

# Linux fundamentals
-The name "Linux" is actually an umbrella term for multiple OS's that are based on UNIX (another operating system)
-commands
-echo:	Output any text that we provide
-whoami:	Find out what user we're currently logged in as!
-ls:	listing
-cd:	change directory
-cat:	concatenate
-pwd:	print working directory
-"Cat" is short for concatenating & is a fantastic way for us to output the contents of files (not just text files!)
-find is efficient must use like this find -name example.txt or find -name *.txt (finds everything that is a text file)
-The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for
-operators
- &	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
- &&	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
- >	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
- >>	This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten)
-Secure Shell or SSH simply is a protocol between devices in an encrypted form
-The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine
-A majority of commands allow for arguments to be provided
- using the -a argument (short for --all), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as hidden folders(used with ls)
-    --help will list the possible options that the command accepts, provide a brief description and example of how to use it
- man is the same as help just use it before command
-the flag -h makes the output human readable
-touch	touch	Create file
-mkdir	make directory	Create a folder
-cp	copy	Copy a file or folder
-mv	move	Move a file or folder
-rm	remove	Remove a file or folder
-file	file	Determine the type of a file
- you need to provide the -R switch alongside the name of the directory you wish to remove
-Switching between users on a Linux install is easy work thanks to the su command
- The etc folder (short for etcetera) is a commonplace location to store system files that are used by your operating system
